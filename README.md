## Creating the bot - Having the token
- The first step in creating our bot is to talk to the BotFather.
- Open Telegram app
- Type in the search form BotFather.
- Hit the start button which will display a list of commands that we can use to interact with the BotFather.
- Let‚Äôs create our bot using the command `/newbot`.
- Now we have to register for a username, note: it must end in bot.
- Command `/token` will give us an API token to access our bot through HTTPS. (We will use it later)
 
 This is the username of the bot @RideBikeBot
